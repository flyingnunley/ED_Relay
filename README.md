# ED_Relay
Electrodragon relay board firmware using visual studio code and platformio development environment.

This code works for the relay boards at ElectroDragon.  So far I have used it on 
https://www.electrodragon.com/product/wifi-iot-relay-board-vdc-based-esp8266/
and 
https://www.electrodragon.com/product/wifi-iot-relay-board-spdt-based-esp8266/

it uses code copied from https://github.com/SensorsIot/Internet-of-Things-with-ESP8266 with several modifications.
