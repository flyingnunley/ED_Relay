# add to sudoers
#Sudoers
sudo su
visudo

#The default pi user on Raspbian is a sudoer. This gives the ability to run commands as root when preceded by sudo, and to switch to the root user with  sudo su.

#To add a new user to sudoers, type sudo visudo (from a sudoer user) and find the line root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, under the commented header  
# User privilege specification. Copy this line and switch from root to the username. To allow passwordless root access, change to NOPASSWD: ALL. The example below gives the user bob passwordless sudo access:

# User privilege specification
root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
matt   ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
Log in as matt
mkdir .ssh
#Save and exit to apply the changes.
scp matt@192.168.1.2:.ssh/authorized_keys .
scp matt@192.168.1.2:.ssh/authorized_keys2 .
scp matt@192.168.1.2:.ssh/id_rsa.pub .

# to set up the change of ownership of the files in the media directory
sudo crontab -e

add line:
*/1 * * * * chown matt /var/www/html/media/*

at this point, I should be able to rsync the files off of the pi

to leave the files as .h264 instead of mp4 edit /etc/raspimjpeg
sudo nano /etc/raspimjpeg
# add this to the MP4Box section
MP4Box Off
